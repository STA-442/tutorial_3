# Logistic Regression

This tutorial consists of a .Rmd file and its knitted html file. The file walks you through the basics of fitting logistic regression models in R and working with the resulting R object. We show you how to compute odds ratios by hand and by working with the fitted object. We conclude by showing you how to compute some accuracy metrics when considering the logistic regression model as a classifier. 

The tutorial introduces an R package for working with messy regression objects, and tidying them into nice `tibbles/data.frame` objects - [the broom package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/broom/vignettes/broom.html)
